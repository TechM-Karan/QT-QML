Requirement:
Implement a 2 way real time communication system (between QT application and test server instance). 
This should enable updating values instantaneously on client or server and the update values should reflect immediately.

Solution:
Server : Local host and port 12345
I have designed an ATM Server where client wants to deposit the amount from the ATM and gets the balance after the depoist
from the server.During the operation I will log the user operation to a file(username.txt) and server operation to file ( server.txt)
Currently I made the input field as fixed
Field 1 : UserName;
Field 2 : Total Balance Amount
Field 3 : Deposit
Field 4 : Deposit Amount.

I am passing Total balance Amount from input because i am not storing the total balance Amount in server.
Response from the server i will get the total balance amount after the operation deposit and deposit amount.

Input request from client:
<user>NANJESH</user> <bal>1000</bal> <oper>D</oper> <DepAmt>100</DepAmt>
NANJESH.TXT file is created maintain user input and response from server.

output response from server:
Response <TotalBalanceAmount>1100</TotalBalanceAmount>
SERVER.TXT file is created to maintain server operation

Enhnacement:
since the requirement says client I have implemented with single client later this can be enhanced with multiple clients.
